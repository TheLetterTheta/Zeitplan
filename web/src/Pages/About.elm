                        Victor Drescher is a music professor at Southeastern Louisiana University.
                        The main developer of this application was one of his students, and was working on a piece
                        of music that was German. Mr. Drescher proposed that it took him hours to plan out when to
                        meet with his students on a weekly basis. Thus, the idea of "The Scheduler" was born!

                        The name, "The Scheduler" wasn't going to stick for very long. So, the project was renamed

                        for a more permanent name, but it eventually stuck. And so, the project is named Zeitplan to this day!
